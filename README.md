# GMSynth - A CLAP attempt to do General MIDI

I unno, I wanna CLAP some Zig and Rust, so I did.

## Deps

You'll need:

- Zig latest
- Rust (tested on 1.68.2)
- Just (casey/just)
- A basic Unix environment (git, tar, curl, make)
- (MacOS) probably xcode-select

## Instructions

```sh
$> just download-deps
$> just
```

The result should be in the root dir, by default under the name "GmSynth.clap".
